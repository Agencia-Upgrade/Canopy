# Installation[¶](#installation "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There are two ways to use LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress (LSCWP): with a
LiteSpeed server, and without one. If you do not have a LiteSpeed
server, and you are not planning to use QUIC.cloud CDN, then please skip
ahead to the [Using LSCWP Without a LiteSpeed
Server](#using-lscwp-without-a-litespeed-server) section.

Before installing and activating the LSCache plugin, deactivate all
other full-page cache plugins.

Tip

You can still use other types of cache (like object cache, or browser
cache), but only one full-page cache should be used at a time.

Tip

It is possible to use multiple optimization plugins at once. Please see
[these instructions](../admin/#using-multiple-optimization-plugins) to
learn how to do so safely.
## Plugin Installation[¶](#plugin-installation "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

Please see the [Overview](../#server-level-prerequisites) for the
server-level requirements before attempting to install this plugin.
1.  [Download the LSCWP
    plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/) from our
    WordPress Plugin Directory page.
2.  Log into your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Plugins \> Add
    New** and click on **Upload Plugin**.
3.  Select the LSCWP zip file and click **Install Now**. Activate the
    plugin.
4.  Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \> Cache** and set **Enable
    Cache** to `ON`.

You may also install the plugin directly from the **Plugins \> Add New**
screen. Replace the first three steps above with:

- Search for `LiteSpeed Cache` in the search box. Our plugin should be
  the first search result to come up.
- Press **Install Now**. Activate the plugin.

### LSCache Check Tool[¶](#lscache-check-tool "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There\'s a simple way to see if a URL is cached by LiteSpeed: the
[LSCache Check](https://check.lscache.io/) Tool.

Enter the URL you wish to check, and the tool will respond with an
easy-to-read Yes or No result, and a display of the URL\'s response
headers, in case you want to examine the results more closely.

[![!LSCache
Check](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify01.png)](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

In addition to LSCache support, the tool can detect cache hits, and can
detect when sites are using LiteSpeed Web ADC or QUIC.cloud CDN for
caching.

Additionally, a Stale Cache Warning will alert you if browser cache is
detected on dynamic pages. This is because browser cache may interfere
with the delivery of fresh content.

### Manual Lookup[¶](#manual-lookup "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

[![!Verify Cache
Miss](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify02.png)](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify02.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

You can verify a page is being served from LSCache through the following
steps:

1.  From a non-logged-in browser, navigate to your site, and open the
    developer tools (usually, right-click \> **Inspect**). Open the
    **Network** tab.

2.  Refresh the page.

3.  Click the first resource. This should be an HTML file. For example,
    if your page is `http://example.com/webapp/`, your first resource
    should either be something like `example.com/webapp/` or `webapp/`.

4.  You should see headings similar to these:

    ::: highlight
        X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss
        X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control:public,max-age=1800
        X-LiteSpeed-Tag:B1_F,B1_ 
    :::

    These headings mean the page had not yet been cached, but that
    LiteSpeed has now stored it, and it will be served from cache with
    the next request.

5.  Reload the page and you should see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` in the
    response header. This means the page is being served by LSCache and
    is configured correctly. [![!Verify Cache
    Hit](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify03.png)](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify03.png){.glightbox
    data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
    desc-position="bottom"}

::: {.admonition .note}
Alternative Headers

The `X-LiteSpeed-Cache` header is most common, but you may see
`X-LSADC-Cache` if your site is served by LiteSpeed Web ADC.

You may also see `X-QC-Cache` and `X-QC-Pop` if your site is served via
QUIC.cloud CDN. The former indicates the cache status (`hit` or `miss`)
and the latter indicates what PoP location (such as `NA-US-LGA-33`)
served this response.

These alternative headers are also an indication that LSCache is working
properly on your site.
::: {.admonition .important}
Important

If you don\'t see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` or `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss`
(or any of the alternative headers), then there is a problem with the
LSCache configuration.
### Non-Cacheable Pages[¶](#non-cacheable-pages "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Sometimes there are pages which should not be cached. To verify that
such pages have indeed been excluded from caching, check the developer
tools as described [above](#verify-your-site-is-being-cached).

You should see headings similar to these:

::: highlight
    X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control:no-cache, esi=on
    X-LiteSpeed-Tag:B1_F,B1_ 
`X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control`, when set to `no-cache`, indicates that
LiteSpeed Server has served your page dynamically, and that it was
*intentionally* not served from cache.

## Using LSCWP Without a LiteSpeed Server[¶](#using-lscwp-without-a-litespeed-server "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Anyone can use the LSCWP plugin, even those who are using Apache, nginx,
or some other non-LiteSpeed server. However, none of the plugin\'s
caching functionality will be available to you. You are free to use all
of the optimization features, but caching does not work without a
LiteSpeed server or QUIC.cloud CDN. To use LSCWP without a LiteSpeed
server or QUIC.cloud CDN:

- Simply install and activate the plugin through the WordPress Admin
  interface.
- Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization**
- Have fun playing with the options! [Page Optimization instructions are
  here](../pageopt), if you need them.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

If you are not currently running a LiteSpeed Web Server with LSCache
enabled, but you would like to use the caching features of the WordPress
plugin, please contact your hosting provider. [Ask them to switch you to
LiteSpeed Web
Server!](https://www.litespeedtech.com/wordpress-acceleration-with-lscache/get-litespeed-hosting)
If that is not an option, check out [QUIC.cloud
CDN](https://quic.cloud), which gives you access to LSCWP caching, no
matter what server your site uses on the backend.
