# Beginner\'s Guide[¶](#beginners-guide "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

We realize there are a lot of settings in this plugin. If you are
overwhelmed and unsure where to begin, read on!

::: {.admonition .tip}
TL;DR

In the event that you want to tweak things a bit, it doesn't hurt to
have a rudimentary understanding of the basic cache settings. There's no
need to read all of this now, though! Use the default settings, bookmark
this page, and come back here when you need the reference.

## Where to Begin[¶](#where-to-begin "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LSCWP essentially has two purposes: that of a full-page cache for your
site's dynamically-generated pages, and that of a site-optimization
plugin. Most people who install LSCache do so for the page cache
functions. The rest of the features are a nice bonus for those who know
how to use them, but they are entirely optional.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

You are free to enable the page cache and ignore everything else.
Upon activation, you'll find that everything is disabled.

To turn on caching, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \> Cache**
and set **Enable Cache** to `ON`. Press the **Save Changes** button.

You could stop right there, never configure another setting, and the
plugin would probably speed up your site very nicely. The default
settings are specifically chosen to work with the majority of sites
right out of the box.

If you\'d like to do a little more, read on!

:::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

You may see a warning similar to this:

::: highlight
    LSCache caching functions on this page are currently unavailable!
    To use the caching functions you must have a LiteSpeed web server or be using QUIC.cloud CDN.
It can mean one of two things:

1.  Your LiteSpeed server\'s cache module is not properly configured. If
    this is the case, please share [this
    documentation](../../start/#configure-cache-root-and-cache-policy)
    with your hosting provider and ask them to enable caching for your
    site.
2.  You are not using a LiteSpeed server at all. If this is the case, it
    is outside of the scope of this Beginner\'s Guide. Please see [Using
    LSCache Without a LiteSpeed
    Server](../installation/#using-lscache-without-a-litespeed-server)
    for more information.
## LSCache Profiles[¶](#lscache-profiles "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LSCache Profiles are a pre-tuned set of options, which can be used for
optimizing any website using Litespeed Cache. We recommend the Basic or
Advanced profile, as they should not require any extra tweaking on your
part. See [the Toolbox page](../toolbox#using-lscache-profiles) to learn
how to apply an LSCache profile.

## The Basic Cache Tabs[¶](#the-basic-cache-tabs "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Let's look at the first four tabs in the Cache section, and see what
they do. These are the most basic settings for your cache.

[![!LSCWP Basic Cache
Tabs](../images/beginner01.png)](../images/beginner01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

This is a high-level overview. For a detailed explanations of each
setting on each tab of the Cache section, please see [the
Screen-by-Screen documentation](../cache).
### Cache Tab[¶](#cache-tab "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The first option on the **Cache** tab turns the caching functionality on
and off. The remaining settings allow you to decide what types of
content will be cached. By default, everything is enabled. If you don't
know what these settings do, it's best to leave them set to their
defaults.

### TTL Tab[¶](#ttl-tab "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

TTL stands for "Time to Live" and it refers to the number of seconds a
page can remain in cache before it is considered stale. Once a page
reaches its TTL, it is purged from cache. We've chosen default TTLs that
should work for most sites, but you are free to change them.

If you would like a deeper understanding of how content is cached and
purged, [take a look at this blog
post](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/07/19/wpw-litespeed-caching-101/).
It's written at a high-level, so you can get the gist without knowing a
lot of jargon.

### Purge Tab[¶](#purge-tab "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There are sometimes situations where pages should be purged before their
natural expiration. This section allows you to define the rules for that
behavior. The default selections should work for most sites, but you can
change them if you need to.

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

If you write a new post, tag it "brownies," and publish it in the
"recipes" category, several pages will change: the home page, the
recipes category archive page, the brownies tag archive page, your
author archive page, and probably some other pages, depending on your
theme.

All of the affected pages will need to be purged in order to avoid
serving stale content. These settings give you an opportunity to adjust
the rules to fit what is needed by your site.
### Excludes Tab[¶](#excludes-tab "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

You may have pages that you don't want cached at all. These options
allow you to exclude specific parts of your site from being cached.
Again, for most sites, there will be no need to change these settings.
They are provided to allow you to make custom exceptions to the cache
rules.

## The Other Cache Tabs[¶](#the-other-cache-tabs "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The rest of the Cache tabs (four or five, depending on whether you have
WooCommerce enabled) cover more advanced types of caching. These are
covered in-depth on the [Screen-by-Screen Cache section
documentation](../cache).

[![!LSCWP Other Cache
Tabs](../images/beginner02.png)](../images/beginner02.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

#### ESI[¶](#esi "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

ESI stands for "Edge Side Includes" and is a method through which you
can "punch holes" in public content, and fill them with private or
uncached content. ESI is useful for things like shopping cart widgets
and personalized greetings, but is disabled by default. [Go in-depth
here](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/09/06/wpw-esi-and-litespeed-cache/).

::: {.admonition .help}
Video

See a video demonstration of **What is Edge Side Includes (ESI)?**
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYpR6D8n3oE).
### Object[¶](#object "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The settings on this tab allow you to control an external object cache
(Memcached, LSMCD, or Redis) which is enabled and configured by the
server admin.

### Browser[¶](#browser "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Browser cache is a client-level cache for static files. With browser
caching enabled, static files (like images) are stored locally on the
user\'s device the first time they are requested. After that, the
content is pulled from their local storage until the browser cache
expires. The settings on this tab control the browser cache.

### Advanced[¶](#advanced "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

As you might guess from the name of this tab, it's aimed at more
experienced users. You are not likely to need this tab, unless you have
some kind of conflict with another cache plugin.

### WooCommerce[¶](#woocommerce "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LSCache is compatible with WooCommerce. If you have WooCommerce enabled,
this tab will appear, and will allow you to configure settings related
to caching shop content.

## Other Plugin Sections[¶](#other-plugin-sections "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There are many more sections to explore in the LSCache plugin. Each of
these is documented in much greater detail in the Screen-by-Screen
section. Links to each section are provided in the descriptions below.

[![!LSCWP
Menu](../images/beginner03.png)](../images/beginner03.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

### Dashboard[¶](#dashboard "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The LiteSpeed Cache Dashboard allows you to see the status of all of
your LSCache and QUIC.cloud services (Image Optimization, Critical CSS
Generation, Low-Quality Image Placeholders, Cache Crawler, etc.) at a
glance. You can also check your page load time and your page speed
score. [Learn more](../dashboard).

### General[¶](#general "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The settings in this section control your usage of QUIC.cloud services,
the ability to auto upgrade the plugin, and which messages you want to
have displayed on the dashboard. [Learn more](../general).

### CDN[¶](#cdn "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This section allows you to configure your Content Delivery Network for
use with WordPress. If you don\'t use a CDN, don't worry about it. CDN
support is disabled by default. [Learn more](../cdn).

### Image Optimization[¶](#image-optimization "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress provides the ability to optimize your
images, making them smaller, and faster to transmit. This is done
through a QUIC.cloud service and can be controlled in this section of
the plugin. [Learn more](../imageopt).

### Page Optimization[¶](#page-optimization "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There are several non-cache measures you can take to speed up your
WordPress site, and many of them are supported in this tab. CSS and
Javascript minification and combination, HTTP/2 push, asynchronous and
deferred load... if you don't know what these things mean, don't worry.
They are disabled by default. [Learn more](../pageopt).

### Database[¶](#database "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This section allows you to optimize your WordPress database. Database
optimization is a useful tool when it comes to speeding up your site.
LSCWP\'s DB Optimizer gives you an easy way to execute some of these
tasks in your WordPress database. [Learn more](../database).

### Crawler[¶](#crawler "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The crawler is disabled by default. When it's active, it travels your
site, refreshing any pages that may have expired from the cache.
Crawling can be a resource-intensive process, and not all hosting
providers will allow its use. If your hosting provider does allow
crawling, it's a nice way to keep your cache fresh. [Learn
more](../crawler).

### Toolbox[¶](#toolbox "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

When you need to manually purge the cache, export your site settings, or
debug an issue, you\'ll find the means in the Toolbox section. Probably
the most useful thing you will find here is the Environment Report. If
you are having a problem and LiteSpeed support asks for your Report
Number, [this](../toolbox/#report-tab) is where you would go to get it.
[Learn more](../toolbox).

## Purging the Cache[¶](#purging-the-cache "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

When you edit a page, the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin will
automatically purge that page from cache, along with related pages like
category, tag, and date archives. Still, there may be rare occasions
where you would like to manually remove your whole site, or a single
page from cache, so that the cache may be rebuilt with fresh content.

### Purge the Whole Site From Cache[¶](#purge-the-whole-site-from-cache "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

This is not something you should have to do often (or *at all*, really).
The plugin should be managing your cache well enough that a step like
this is unnecessary. If you find yourself having to purge your whole
site regularly, post a question on [our WordPress support
forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/litespeed-cache). We should
be able to suggest a way to avoid manual purges.
[![!LSCWP Purge
All](../images/beginner04.png)](../images/beginner04.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

From the WP-Admin Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \>
Purge**. Click the **Purge All LSCache** button. All of the pages on
your site will be cleared from cache.

There are other types of Purge actions on this page, but you can ignore
them, if you have a simple setup and have not enabled any of the
optimization features. To learn more about what the other Purge actions
do, you can take a look at [the Purge
documentation](../toolbox/#purge-tab).

### Purge a Single Page From Cache[¶](#purge-a-single-page-from-cache "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

[![!LSCWP Purge
Page](../images/beginner05.png)](../images/beginner05.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

To clear the cache for a single page, you would use the **Purge this
page - LSCache** option. Here\'s how:

First, make sure you are logged into your WordPress Admin account.
Purging a page is not done from the WP-Admin Dashboard. It\'s done from
the front end (visitor view) of your site, but you need to be logged in
so that the Admin Bar appears.

In your browser visit the page you wish to purge. Hover your cursor over
the LiteSpeed Cache icon on the black Admin Bar at the top of the page.
(The LiteSpeed Cache icon looks like a diamond with a tiny lightning
bolt in the center.) A menu will pop up, and the first option will be
**Purge this page - LSCache**. Click the link. The cache will be purged
for that page, and the page will be reloaded.
