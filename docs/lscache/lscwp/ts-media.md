## Image Optimization[¶](#image-optimization "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you are experiencing image optimization errors and you don\'t see the
solution here, if you have a QUIC.cloud account, you can check your
QUIC.cloud Dashboard at `https://my.quic.cloud/dm/example.com/img_optm`.
(Be sure to replace `example.com` with your own site URL.) There should
be guidance on the Dashboard that will let you know how to proceed.

If you are still unsure, or you are an anonymous QUIC.cloud user with no
Dashboard, then please [create a
ticket](https://www.quic.cloud/support/) and include your site\'s
[Report Number](../troubleshoot/#get-a-report-number).

### Trouble Getting Started[¶](#trouble-getting-started "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you are having difficulty getting your first images optimized, try
these steps to get the process started:

- Have you [enabled QUIC.cloud
  services](../general/#online-services-tab)? If not, do so.
- Is your [server IP](../general/#server-ip) accurate? It should either
  be empty, or it should be set to your server\'s correct IP address.
- If your domain is linked to QUIC.cloud, then visit your QUIC.cloud
  Dashboard, and check **Domain \> Settings** to be sure the **Server
  IP** is set to your server\'s correct IP address.
- If you have firewall, please make sure that [our
  IPs](https://quic.cloud/ips) are not blocked. They should be
  allowlisted.
- If you have a security plugin, please make sure that [WP REST API is
  not disabled](https://docs.quic.cloud/troubleshooting/restapi/).

### Out of Quota Warning[¶](#out-of-quota-warning "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Everyone receives a free quota to use with each of the online services.
This quota resets at the beginning of every month.

For Image Optimization, there are two request queues. Quota applies to
usage of the Fast Queue, while the Standard Queue remains free and
unlimited.

If you are seeing a message that you are out of quota for the month,
*this should not be happening*. You should always be able to submit
images via the Standard Queue, even if you are out of Fast Queue quota.
To solve this problem, try [disconnecting and re-enabling QUIC.cloud
services](../general/#online-services-tab).

Then try submitting your images again.

### Limit Stuck at 1[¶](#limit-stuck-at-1 "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Image Optimization always starts with a limit of 1. This is used as a
test run to make sure that the Image Optimization servers are able to
connect to your server.

If your Image Optimization limit is at 1 and it does not increase after
a few requests, check the following to determine a proper remedy:

First, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Image Optimization \> Image
Optimization Summary** and check the **Image Optimization Status \>
Failed Image Optimization** counter. It is likely increasing. This can
be one of several issues:

- The image is already optimized: This is not a cause for concern. It
  will keep trying other images, and when an unoptimized one is found,
  the limit will increase.
- The Image Optimization server is unable to find your image: Please
  check your rewrite rules and links.
- The Image Optimization server is unable to connect to your server: To
  fix this, add the [QUIC.cloud IP list](https://www.quic.cloud/ips) to
  your allowlist.

If you have a QUIC.cloud account, please check our [QUIC.cloud
documentation](https://docs.quic.cloud/troubleshooting/imageopt/) for
further information on how to check your Image Optimization status.

### No Valid Image Found[¶](#no-valid-image-found "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    No valid image found in the current request.
To clear this error, navigate to **LSCache \> Image Optimization** and
click the **Rescan New Thumbnails** link.

### Too Many Requested Images[¶](#too-many-requested-images "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    You have too many requested images, please try again in a few minutes.
This error occurs when the current count of images sent for optimization
exceeds 200. This is simply a safety mechanism, to ensure a site
doesn\'t send thousands of images for optimization without confirmation
that optimization is actually ongoing.

Wait a few minutes for the service to finish some of the requested
images before sending a new batch.

### Too Many Notified Images[¶](#too-many-notified-images "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    You have too many notified images, please pull down notified images first.
If you have more than 1000 images listed as \"notified\" (meaning, they
are ready to pull down), new requests are blocked. You should pull the
optimized images prior to sending new ones.

You can manually pull images down, or, you can have them automatically
pulled by WP-Cron. For the latter, set **LSCache \> Image Optimization
\> Image Optimization Settings \> Auto Pull Cron** to `ON`.

If the cron is failing to pull your images, you can try this command to
see what happens:

::: highlight
    wp cron event run --due-now
### Failed to Retrieve Image[¶](#failed-to-retrieve-image "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    Failed to retrieve image for optimization
This error, which you may see on your [QUIC.cloud
Dashboard](https://my.quic.cloud) if you have a QUIC.cloud account,
indicates that the image to be optimized no longer exists at the
original URL that was submitted. You may see this if you have moved
image files.

### Failed to Retrieve Original Image[¶](#failed-to-retrieve-original-image "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    Failed to retrieve original image
This error, which you may see on your [QUIC.cloud
Dashboard](https://my.quic.cloud) if you have a QUIC.cloud account,
indicates that there was an md5 mismatch between the original image on
your site, and the copy that was retreived. This can happen if you\'ve
used plugins that modify images in some way, such as resizing
thumbnails.

### Failed to Notify WP[¶](#failed-to-notify-wp "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Error Message:

::: highlight
    Failed to notify WP to pick up optimized images
This error, which you may see on your [QUIC.cloud
Dashboard](https://my.quic.cloud) if you have a QUIC.cloud account,
indicates that QUIC.cloud was unable to inform your WordPress
installation that images are ready to be pulled. This may happen if
QUIC.cloud IPs are not allowlisted at the firewall, or if there is some
other kind of error communicating with your site.

## Next-Gen Image Formats[¶](#next-gen-image-formats "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### WebP/AVIF Images Not Generated[¶](#webpavif-images-not-generated "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If WebP or AVIF images can\'t be found in your file system, it is
usually due to one of two reasons:

- **Next-Gen Image Format** was selected too late: a format should be
  selected *before* you begin Image Optimization. If you enable WebP or
  AVIF *after* you have already begun Image Optimization, next-gen files
  will not be created for any images that have already been processed.
  If you wish to create WebP/AVIF files for images that were already
  optimized, then you will need to **[Soft Reset Image Optimization
  Counter](../imageopt/#soft-reset-optimization-counter)** so next-gen
  formats can be created for those earlier images.
- The WebP or AVIF file is bigger than the JPEG: When Image Optimization
  creates a next-gen file, if it is larger in size than the JPEG, the
  next-gen file is discarded, since there is no benefit to serving a
  larger next-gen file over a smaller JPEG.

Once all of the site\'s image optimization is complete, if you have a
question about the WebP or AVIF for a particular image, you can try
optimizing it again and see what happens. here\'s how:

[![!LSCWP Reoptimize
Image](../images/ts-media01.png)](../images/ts-media01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

1.  Hover over the image in the Media Library and click on the **Restore
    from backup** link that appears. This will remove the optimized
    files and restore the image to its unoptimized state.
2.  Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Image Optimization** and Click the
    **Gather Image Data** button, followed by the **Send Optimization
    Request** button. The image you restored will be optimized along
    with any new Media Library items that were waiting for optimization
    (alternatively, if your Image Optimization is handled automatically
    by cron, you could just wait, and the image will be sent with the
    next automatic batch).
3.  Check the image in the Media Library again once optimization is
    complete. Is there a WebP or AVIF now? If not, then it\'s probably a
    case where the next-gen version of the image was discarded because
    it was too big.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

The **WebP** or **AVIF** indicator next to a Media Library image
indicates that next-gen images were generated for at least one of the
image sizes in that group. It is possible, however, that some image
sizes do *not* have corresponding next-gen versions. When this happens
it is usually because the next-gen image was not smaller than the JPG or
the PNG.
### WebP/AVIF Not Loading[¶](#webpavif-not-loading "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you\'ve generated next-gen images through Image Optimization, but
they are not showing on the front end, there may be a few reasons:

1.  Not all browsers support WebP or AVIF. [Make sure you are using one
    that does](https://caniuse.com/webp).
2.  The plugin can only perform next-gen replacement on the HTML `<img>`
    tag. If the image is loaded via CSS, JS, or some other means,
    LSCache may not be able to correctly insert the next-gen file.
3.  Are you sure the WebP or AVIF file actually exists? You can add
    `.webp` or `.avif` to the end of any image file to see if a next-gen
    version exists. For example, if you have an image
    `https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/test.jpg`, enter
    `https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/test.jpg.webp`
    into a browser that supports WebP images. If the WebP image exists,
    it will display. If it doesn\'t exist, please see [WebP/AVIF Images
    Not Generated](#webp-avif-images-not-generated) for further
    troubleshooting.

If you are still unsure what is going on, the Debug Log might help.
Here\'s how to check it:

1.  Navigate to **Toolbox \> Debug Settings**, set **Debug Log** to `ON`
    and **Debug Level** to `Advanced`.
2.  Navigate to **Toolbox \> Purge** and click the **Purge All -
    LSCache** button.
3.  Visit your website, and view the page where you think the next-gen
    image file should display.
4.  Back in the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Toolbox \> Log View**
    and see if the Debug Log can clear up the mystery.
5.  Navigate to **Toolbox \> Debug Settings** and set **Debug Log** to
    `OFF`.

### Some WebP/AVIF Load, Some do Not[¶](#some-webpavif-load-some-do-not "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have a situation where next-gen versions of all of your images
definitely exist in the file system, but only some of them are being
served, take a look at the way those images are referenced. Does the
domain name match the **Settings \> General \> Site Address (URL)**
setting? If it doesn\'t match, then the JPEG will *not* be replaced with
WebP.

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

Your site address is `www.example.com`, and the page refers to two
images: one at `www.example.com/image1.jpg`, and the other at
`example.com/image2.jpg`. Only the `image1` WebP (from the `www` domain)
is being displayed, while `image2` (from the naked domain) is still
being shown as a JPEG.
Make sure that your images are prefaced with an accurate site address,
and next-gen image files will be displayed, if they exist, and if the
browser supports it.

## Lazy Load[¶](#lazy-load "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### Third Party Conflicts[¶](#third-party-conflicts "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Modern page builders such as Elementor and Visual Composer, as well as
many WordPress themes and plugins related to handling media files,
include Lazy Load as a core functionality. To avoid conflicts, we
recommend that you only enable Lazy Load in a single plugin (LiteSpeed
Cache), and disable it in any other plugin or theme you are using.

### Excluding Images[¶](#excluding-images "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you find some images should not be lazy loaded, you can exclude them
in **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization \> Media Excludes**. Add the
URL to **Lazy Load Image Excludes**.

Alternately, if you are a developer, you can add the attribute
`data-no-lazy="1"` to the image in your HTML code.

### Logo disappears on page refresh[¶](#logo-disappears-on-page-refresh "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your site\'s logo disappears each time you refresh the page, but then
it comes back after a brief delay, this is likely because the LiteSpeed
plugin is lazy loading the image.

To address this, you need to exclude the logo image URL or filename from
Lazy Loading. Here\'s how:

1.  Copy the filename or URL for the logo
2.  Navigate to **Litespeed Cache \> Page Optimization \> Media
    Excludes**
3.  Find the [**Lazy Load Image
    Excludes**](/lscache/lscwp/pageopt/#lazy-load-image-excludes)
    setting
4.  Paste the logo filename or URL into the text box and click the
    **Save Changes** button
5.  Purge the site\'s cache, either via the Admin Bar\'s LiteSpeed icon,
    or via the **Toolbox \> Purge \> [Purge All -
    LSCache](/lscache/lscwp/toolbox/#purge-all-lscache)** button.

Return to your WordPress site front end and refresh the page. Your logo
image should now remain visible even after a page refresh.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

To force all above-the-fold images on every page to be excluded from
lazy load, try [the QUIC cloud Viewport Images (VPI)
service](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2022/08/02/viewport-images-service/).
