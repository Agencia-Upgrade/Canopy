# Troubleshooting CSS/JS Issues[¶](#troubleshooting-cssjs-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your site no longer displays correctly after enabling optimization
features, it may not be a plugin problem. It may be an issue with a
single CSS or JavaScript file in your theme or other plugins,
conflicting with one or more optimizations.

## Finding Conflicts[¶](#finding-conflicts "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### Verify it\'s a Page Optimization Issue[¶](#verify-its-a-page-optimization-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Before we go to too much trouble, let\'s make sure that it really is an
optimization issue.

In a private/incognito browser window (or separate browser not logged in
to WordPress), view your site without any of the CSS, JS, and other page
optimizations enabled by appending `/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm` to the end
of the link.

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

For `www.example.com`, use `www.example.com/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm` to
see the page without optimizations.
How does the site look without optimizations?

- [it still looks bad](#it-still-looks-bad)
- [it looks good now](#it-looks-good-now)

#### It still looks bad[¶](#it-still-looks-bad "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your site is still not displaying correctly, then the problem is NOT
with LSCache\'s optimization features.

What happens if you deactivate the LSCache plugin completely? Does the
site look fine? If so, then some other feature of LSCache is interfering
with your site. [Visit our
forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/litespeed-cache/), and let
us know what\'s happening.

If the site is still messed-up even after deactivating LSCache, then the
issue is related to something else on your site. Try disabling your
other plugins one-by-one, or contact your hosting provider for further
assistance.

#### It looks good now[¶](#it-looks-good-now "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This confirms that the issue lies somewhere in the optimization
features. Now you have two options:

- Turn off the CSS and JS optimization functions for good, and purge the
  cache. This is an easy solution, and if you choose to do this, your
  site can still benefit greatly from caching even without optimization
  enabled. Remember, you don\'t have to use the CSS or JS optimizations
  to use LSCache!
- Turn those options back on, do some troubleshooting to find the
  problematic file, and exclude that file from optimization. If you want
  to go this route, proceed to the next step.

If you really don\'t want to do the detective work yourself you can
[hire LiteSpeed to do it for you](../troubleshoot/#additional-support).
### Verify it\'s a CSS/JS Optimization Issue[¶](#verify-its-a-cssjs-optimization-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Try the following steps to pinpoint CSS and JavaScript errors:

1.  **Turn off optimization**: from the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to
    **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization**. Click the **CSS Settings**
    tab, and set all of the CSS optimization features to `OFF`. Click
    the **JS Settings** tab, and set all of the JS optimization features
    to `OFF`.
2.  **Purge the cache**: navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \>
    Purge** and press the **Purge All** button.
3.  **Check your site**: reload the page. Does it still look bad?

If it still looks bad, then your problem is likely [something
else](/lscache/lscwp/troubleshoot/).

If it no longer looks bad, then there is JavaScript or CSS somewhere on
your site that is incompatible with some LSCache optimization features.
This guide will help you to find the problematic files and exclude them
from optimization.

### Identify Whether it\'s a CSS or JavaScript Issue[¶](#identify-whether-its-a-css-or-javascript-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The first step in finding the problematic file is determining whether we
are looking at a JavaScript issue or a CSS issue.

Let\'s check JavaScript first:

1.  Check that the JS-related optimization functions are enabled, and
    the CSS functions are disabled.
2.  Purge the cache, if you enabled/disabled anything in the first step.
3.  View the page. How does it look?
4.  If it\'s messy, then one of your JS files is problematic. Jump ahead
    to [Find and Exclude](#find-and-exclude-the-problematic-files).
5.  If it\'s fine, then your JS files are also fine and you can move on
    the check CSS.

If JavaScript wasn\'t the culprit, then it\'s probably CSS. Let\'s
verify.

1.  Disable the JS-related optimization functions, and re-enable the CSS
    functions.
2.  Purge the cache again.
3.  View the page. How does it look?
4.  It should be messy, proving that one of your CSS files is
    problematic.

Now that you know whether it\'s CSS or JS, you\'ll need to find the
specific file that is causing the problem.

### Find and Exclude the Problematic File(s)[¶](#find-and-exclude-the-problematic-files "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

For the purposes of these instructions, we\'re going to assume you have
a CSS file causing trouble. If, in fact, your issue is with JavaScript,
you can still follow these same steps. Just imagine that the
instructions say \"JS\" everywhere that they say \"CSS.\"
In order to find the file that is at fault, first we need to get a list
of all possible CSS (or JS) files. Once that is done, we will exclude
the entire list of files from optimization, and then reintroduce them
one-by-one until we\'ve found our culprit.

#### Get a List[¶](#get-a-list "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

[![!](../images/ts-optimize01.png)](../images/ts-optimize01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

1.  Visit your site with optimizations disabled by appending
    `/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm` to the end of your URL. This ensures that
    you are getting a list of the original CSS files, and not the
    LiteSpeed-generated versions.
2.  Using the browser\'s Developer Tools, visit the **Network** tab, and
    click **CSS** to view only the CSS files.
3.  Reload the page. You should see a list of all of the CSS files in
    use by that page, listed in the **Name** column.
4.  Make a list of these files. You will have to exclude them all from
    optimization, as described in the next step.

If you need to see the full path of any one CSS file, click on the name
of that file, and click **Headers**. You will find the full location of
the selected file listed as **Request URL**.

#### Test the List[¶](#test-the-list "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

For the following steps, if you are working with CSS files, you\'ll add
your exclusions in the **Tuning - CSS** tab as described. If you are
working with JS files, you\'ll add your exclusions in the **Tuning**
tab.
[![!](../images/ts-optimize02.png)](../images/ts-optimize02.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}
[![!](../images/ts-optimize03.png)](../images/ts-optimize03.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

1.  Enable all of the optimization functions you wish to use.
2.  Exclude all of the CSS files from optimization: Navigate to
    **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization \> Tuning - CSS** and enter
    the files from your list, one-per-line, in the [**CSS
    Excludes**](../pageopt/#css-excludes) box.
3.  Purge the cache and check the site. It should be displaying
    correctly.
4.  Remove one of the CSS files from the exclude list, and purge the
    cache.
5.  Check the site.
    1.  If it still looks okay, then that file you just removed was not
        the problematic file.
    2.  If the site looks broken, then you know you have found a
        problematic CSS file. Put it back in the box and leave it there.
    3.  If there are more unchecked files, repeat from Step 4.

At the end of this process your site should look good, all of the
optimization functions you wish to use should be enabled, and you should
have one or more problematic CSS or JS files sitting the in the CSS
Excludes or JS Excludes box and eliminated from future optimization.

Don\'t forget, if this feels like too much trouble, [we can do it for
you](../troubleshoot/#additional-support).
### Advanced Tuning[¶](#advanced-tuning "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

You would probably like to try skipping some steps. If you are
experienced with website optimization, or if you know you only changed
one plugin before the issues started, then you may be able to save some
time. Here are a few practical tips to help you know what to look for,
to save you time, and to make sure you haven\'t missed anything:

::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

If you\'re already logged into WordPress, then either open a
private/incognito window or use another browser.
1.  Inspect the problematic area

    Right-click the problematic area and select **Inspect**. This will
    open your browser\'s Developer Tools and show you related sections
    of code. That should give you hints to help recognize which
    plugin/theme might need tuning either in the plugin/theme\'s own
    settings or by exclusion from LSCache optimization. If it\'s not
    obvious, try comparing this Inspect window to one for a
    [non-optimized version](#verify-its-a-page-optimization-issue) of
    the page.

2.  Check for browser errors

    While you have Developer Tools open (you can toggle with F12 key),
    select the **Console** tab and see if any **Errors** are there since
    they could mention which file or inline code is affected.

3.  Check the waterfall

    Before and after changes, you should check the waterfall under the
    **Network** tab in your browser\'s Developer Tools to see:

    - Which order things load
    - Which files are taking noticeably longer to load than others
    - Which files are loading longer than before changes were made
      - If all resources from a domain are loading slowly then see some
        more [page loading troubleshooting
        tips](../../tips/#checking-page-load-speed)

4.  Make sure your site is mobile-friendly

    There\'s usually an icon that looks like a cell phone & tablet next
    to each other in the corner of Developer Tools that you can use to
    view your site as if you\'re using other types of devices. Click
    that icon to can make sure that your site looks and functions
    properly while optimized. It\'s best to do this from a computer,
    since you can\'t use Developer Tools very well on touchscreens if at
    all. You may also want to test with different **Throttling** options
    to simulate slower connection speeds.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

If you have **Guest Mode** enabled then you may want to test as if
you\'re always a first time visitor by temporarily adding or removing
[the user agent or IP address](../general/#guest-mode-user-agents) that
you\'re testing with. If not, the page will refresh so fast you won\'t
be able to see any details on what it was like in \"Guest Mode\" before.
## Other Issues[¶](#other-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### CSS/JS Changes Causing Frequent Cache Miss[¶](#cssjs-changes-causing-frequent-cache-miss "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If CSS or JS change frequently on your site, you may experience frequent
cache misses due to the way that LSCWP handles cache management with the
**CSS/JS Combine** option.

#### What May be Happening[¶](#what-may-be-happening "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Your site has CSS or JavaScript content that changes very frequently.
This is likely because of random numbers or strings in the selectors, or
something along those lines, and these random strings regenerate often
(for example, with every new visitor, or every ten minutes, etc.).

- When the CSS or JS changes, the combined CSS or JS must be
  regenerated.
- And when the combined CSS or JS is regenerated, all cache entries for
  the pages which include that CSS/JS must be purged.
- And once the pages are purged, the next visitors will experience a
  cache miss.

So many cache misses affect site performance and user experience.

#### How to Confirm[¶](#how-to-confirm "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Using your browser\'s Developer Tools, navigate to the Network tab and
reload an affected page on your site.

In the list of loaded files, locate the combined CSS file and the
combined JS file, and make note of the file names.

Reload the page. Click the first resource, which should be the page you
just loaded. Look for the `X-LiteSpeed-Cache:` header. If it\'s a `hit`,
reload the page until you see a `miss`. Now note those combined CSS and
JS file names again. Have the names of the files changed?

If a cache miss on the page is always accompanied by a combined CSS
filename change, or a combined JS filename change, then you can confirm
that frequent cache misses are being caused by frequently changing CSS
or JS.

#### How to Stop the Purge[¶](#how-to-stop-the-purge "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

There are two ways to deal with this problem:

1.  Disable **CSS Combine** and/or **JS Combine**. This is the easiest
    solution, but it is not ideal, as it turns off all combination.
2.  Find the problematic selector(s) that are frequently changing, and
    exclude only those selectors from combination.

Read on to learn how to find and exclude the problematic selector(s).

For these instructions, we\'ll assume that it was the combined CSS file
that was changing frequently. The process is exactly the same for
JavaScript; simply replace \"CSS\" with \"JS\" in every step.

1.  In the developer tools, double click the combined CSS file to open
    it in a new tab.
2.  Return to the browser tab with your site\'s page and reload until
    you see the combined CSS file name change again in developer tools.
3.  Double click the combined CSS file to open it in a new tab.
4.  Copy and paste each version of combined CSS into a diff checker site
    (such as <https://www.diffchecker.com/>) and compare.
5.  You should see a few lines of CSS highlighted. This is where the two
    combined files differ, and indicates where the problematic selectors
    are.
6.  Presumably the selectors will have a common string (for example,
    with `abc_12345` and `abc_67890`, the common string is `abc_`).
    Figure out what that is for your combined CSS.
7.  To find out where those selectors are coming from, turn off **CSS
    Combine** temporarily, reload the page, and note the individual CSS
    files that are included on the page.
8.  Search each of those files for the common string from the
    problematic selector.
9.  Once you find it, from your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to
    **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization \> Tuning - CSS** and enter
    the CSS filename in the **CSS Excludes** box. If there are multiple
    CSS files, add all of them, one per line.
10. If the problematic selector is not in a file, but is inline with the
    page\'s HTML, then navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page
    Optimization \> Tuning - CSS** and enter the common string from the
    selectors in the **CSS Excludes** box. If there are multiple sets of
    problematic selectors, add all of them, one per line.
11. Re-enable **CSS Combine**.

This should put a stop to the frequent changes to Combined CSS, which
will in turn stop the frequent purging and cache misses.

You can use the developer tools like before to confirm this solution has
been a success.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

If you have **CSS Minification** enabled, chances are the problematic
CSS string has been minimized as well and doesn\'t actually appear as-is
in any of the original CSS files. If you want to exclude the problematic
CSS string from optimization, you will need to do one of two things:

1.  Don\'t exclude the entire string; only exclude a partial string that
    will not be affected by minification
2.  Turn off minification, and repeat the process to find the
    problematic string in its original form

The same issue and solution also apply to minimized JavaScript.
### Disk Space Filling Fast[¶](#disk-space-filling-fast "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Some plugins may generate CSS or JavaScript with random strings. If
**CSS Combine** or **JS Combine** is enabled, the presence of such
random strings will cause a new combined file to be created for each
page in the site. If the site has a separate mobile view, then there
will be two combined files created for each page in the site. For each
additional cache vary, another set of combined files will be created. As
you can imagine, this is not ideal, and has the potential to fill up
your server space.

To stop this behavior, you must exclude the randomized CSS or JS from
being combined. There are two ways to approach this, and depending on
how big of a problem this is on your site, **you might need to use both
methods to get all of the random strings**.

#### Inline CSS or JS[¶](#inline-css-or-js "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This method has you view the page source for an affected page in two
different browsers, and compare the views to find any inline CSS or JS
that differs between the two pages.

- Visit your site, appending `/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm` to the end of
  the domain name (as in `example.com/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm`), in two
  separate browsers or incognito windows.
- View the page source in each window
- Copy and paste each source into a diff checker site (such as
  <https://www.diffchecker.com/>) and compare
- You should see a few lines of CSS or JS highlighted. This is where the
  two page loads differ, and indicates where the random strings are.
- Presumably the string will have a common part (for example, with
  `abc_12345` and `abc_67890`, the common part is `abc_`). Figure out
  what that is for your page.
- Enter the common part of the random string in **CSS Excludes** or **JS
  Excludes** as appropriate.
- Purge All CSS/JS

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

In the image below, the highlighted areas all include a CSS id that
begins with `.tdi_` and ends with a random group of characters (`2_35c`
in one window, and `2_5f5` in the other). [![!Diff after loading the
page in separate
windows](../images/ts-optimize04.png)](../images/ts-optimize04.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

You would exclude the string `.tdi_` from CSS optimization.
#### Combined CSS or JS Files[¶](#combined-css-or-js-files "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This method has you look in the combined CSS or combined JS directory
and compare two of the generated files to find any differences. This is
easiest if you have minification turned off.

[![](../images/ts-optimize05.png)](../images/ts-optimize05.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

- Using your control panel file manager or FTP, navigate to the
  `wp-content/litespeed/css` or `wp-content/litespeed/js` directory to
  check CSS or JavaScript, respectively
- Look for two files that have a similar size. In the image above, we
  found two files in the `js` directory that were 132.74 KB and 132.7 KB
- Copy and paste the contents of each file into a diff checker site
  (such as <https://www.diffchecker.com/>) and compare
- You should see at least one line highlighted. This is where the two
  combined files differ, and indicates where the random strings are.
- Presumably the strings will have a common part (for example, with
  `abc_12345` and `abc_67890`, the common part is `abc_`). Figure out
  what that is for your page.
- Enter the common part of the random string in **CSS Excludes** or **JS
  Excludes** as appropriate.
- Purge All CSS/JS

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

The image below shows one difference between two combined CSS files: the
strings `tdi_49_013` and `tdi_49_5d0`. This means that we should add
`.tdi_` to **CSS Excludes**. [![!Diff after loading combined CSS in
separate
windows](../images/ts-optimize06.png)](../images/ts-optimize06.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}
### Combined CSS or JS 404 Errors[¶](#combined-css-or-js-404-errors "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you find that requests for combined CSS or combined JavaScript files
are returning `404 Not Found` errors, it is likely due to a periodic
directory cleanup by your hosting provider.

In our experience, reports of these 404 errors can be attributed to
hosting providers deleting the CSS and JS files without the users\'
knowledge. (Occasionally, we\'ve seen this caused by a third party
plugin, but usually it\'s the hosting provider.)

To verify that this is happening, try the following:

1.  View Source for a page that routinely gives you issues, and make
    note of the name of the combined CSS or combined JS file.
2.  Gain SSH access to the server, and navigate to your site\'s
    WordPress root directory.
3.  Use the following command to monitor the file in
    `wp-content/litespeed/css` (if it\'s a CSS file) or
    `wp-content/litespeed/js` (if it\'s a JS file) and write the output
    to a file. Be sure to replace the `css/filename.css` portion of
    `wp-content/litespeed/css/filename.css` with the actual file name
    you found in Step 1, and the appropriate `css` or `js` directory:

    ::: highlight
        while true; do echo -n "$(date)  :  "; ls -l wp-content/litespeed/css/filename.css; echo; sleep 1; done | tee monitor_log
    :::

    Keep the command running and watch for file deletions.
4.  If a deletion happens, note the time, and then repeat the monitoring
    process. Doing this should allow you to discover a pattern in the
    timing, which you can pass along to your hosting provider for
    further assistance.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

This approach takes time and patience. Avoid making site updates while
you are monitoring for file deletions. You don\'t want to trigger any
purge actions that would interfere with your testing.
::: {.admonition .info}
Info

**So, why would a hosting provider delete your CSS and JS files,
anyway?** Usually these cleanup processes were put in place as a way to
address a problem with the way previous versions of the LSCWP plugin
would generate CSS/JS files. It was not uncommon for the CSS and JS
directories to fill up quickly. This cleanup is no longer necessary, as
the excessive CSS/JS generation issue has been solved in the plugin.
### CSS Not Properly Reloaded After Update[¶](#css-not-properly-reloaded-after-update "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Most likely, this is not an LSCache issue, since LSCWP doesn\'t cache
static files.

If your theme\'s CSS is not properly loaded after an update, check your
browser cache. Does the reload work? Do you have a CDN or a reverse
proxy in front of your web server, such as Cloudflare? These caching
mechanisms may need to be purged. See [this forum
post](https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/forum/threads/wordpress-css-not-reloading.15588/#post-99620)
for more details.

### Critical CSS Not Loading[¶](#critical-css-not-loading "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

First and foremost, please make sure that [all of our service node IP\'s
are allowlisted](https://docs.quic.cloud/onboarding/allowlist/) on your
server, your WordPress security plugins (if any), or other security
apparatus on your website such as a CDN/Application Layer Firewall.

If it still isn\'t working after that, take a look at the following:

- Check the `wp-content/litespeed/ccss/` directory for any CSS files,
  and check if any CSS files are generated. Files should be generated
  inside that directory for each of the Post Types on your WordPress
  site.
- If the CSS files do not exist or the CCSS folder does not exist, wait
  for the cron to execute. The cron will generate CCSS from our Cloud
  Servers.
- If the CSS files exist and are valid, do a **Purge All - LScache**
  option from the LSCache menu on the Admin Bar. The new CSS would not
  have been included in older cached pages.
- If the CSS files contain `ccss-timeout`, it means communication with
  your server timed-out when we tried to generate Critical CSS. In this
  case, delete that CSS file manually and **Purge ALL - LScache** so
  that it can re-generate.
- If the CSS files contain `Syntax Error`, then one of your CSS files
  contains an error. You can narrow down the actual erroneous CSS file
  like so:
  1.  Turn off **CSS Combine and Minify**
  2.  **Purge All** and **Purge Critical CSS**
  3.  Try to re-generate CCSS. The next CSS file generated inside
      `wp-content/litespeed/ccss/` should show the real CSS file which
      has the syntax error.
  4.  Fix the syntax error in the CSS file indicated, and **Purge
      Critical CSS**.
  5.  Re-enable **CSS Minify** and **CSS Combine** again now.

### Still Seeing FOUC with Critical CSS Enabled[¶](#still-seeing-fouc-with-critical-css-enabled "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The Critical CSS (CCSS) feature is supposed to eliminate Flash of
Unstyled Content (FOUC), so why do you sometimes still see it?

When **Load CSS Asynchronously** is enabled, your site\'s CSS will be
loaded at the same time as the HTML. So any content that is loaded
before the relevant CSS will be rendered without style, as in this
screenshot.

[![!](../images/ts-optimize07.jpg)](../images/ts-optimize07.jpg){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

LiteSpeed automatically generates Critical CSS as part of the **Load CSS
Asynchronously** setting, in order to stop this behavior. It inserts
essential CSS style rules inline into the page HTML, so that those rules
are executed before the content loads. (You can learn more about how
this works, [on our
blog](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2018/06/20/critical-css-and-litespeed-cache/).)

Sometimes, though, you may notice unstyled content, even with Critical
CSS generated.

#### Cause:[¶](#cause "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

FOUC happens when CCSS has not been inserted inline into the HTML of the
page.

When a page renders unstyled, check the source code. You will probably
see something similar to this:

::: highlight
        <style id="litespeed-optm-css-rules"></style>
In the image below, it\'s the area marked in red on line 4.

[![!](../images/ts-optimize08.jpg)](../images/ts-optimize08.jpg){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

The `<style>` tags are there, but they are empty, which means CCSS is
enabled, but the rule is not yet generated/inserted into the page.

#### Possible Explanations[¶](#possible-explanations "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

So, why wouldn\'t the CCSS be inserted into the page yet?

It takes a few seconds to generate Critical CSS, and if you have set
**Generate Critical CSS in the Background** to `ON`, LSCache adds the
page to a cron-based queue so that the CCSS may be calculated later. As
a result, there may be times when the page is loaded *before* the CCSS
is available, and this leads to FOUC.

Please be aware that same types of pages share the same CCSS. For
example, if you have post1, post2 and post3, when you access post1, CCSS
will be generated. That CCSS will then be there and ready to use when
post2 and post3 are accessed.

#### Solution[¶](#solution "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Try a **Purge All - LSCache** after the CCSS rules are generated. This
will allow LSCache to insert CCSS into pages that had been already
cached *before* the CCSS was generated.

[![!](../images/ts-optimize09.jpg)](../images/ts-optimize09.jpg){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

#### Verify[¶](#verify "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

When CCSS is properly inserted, you will see the rules inserted between
the `<style>` tags, as shown by the red line in the image below:

[![!](../images/ts-optimize10.jpg)](../images/ts-optimize10.jpg){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

### Debug Critical CSS Generation[¶](#debug-critical-css-generation "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have verified that CCSS has failed to generate, this may be due
to a syntax error. There are a few ways to look for such errors in your
CSS.

#### Method 1: QUIC.cloud Dashboard[¶](#method-1-quiccloud-dashboard "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#method-1-quiccloud-dashboard}

If you have linked your site to QUIC.cloud, you can check in the
QUIC.cloud dashboard. Navigate to the **Page Optimization** tab, and
look for any warnings in the **Recent Requests** area.

If these is a problem, a CSS Syntax Error would be clearly displayed,
along with the path to the CSS file that has the error, and a
description of the error. Fix the syntax error in the original file, and
CCSS should begin working properly.

#### Method 2: Your File System[¶](#method-2-your-file-system "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have not linked your site to QUIC.cloud, you can directly check
your file system. Navigate to the `/wp-content/litespeed/ccss` directory
by FTP or your control panel file manager. Look inside the CSS files in
that directory. One of them should contain a syntax error.

[![!](../images/ts-optimize11.png)](../images/ts-optimize11.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

In this example, `home.CSS` gives us the `Unclosed block` syntax error
and tells us where to find the file to fix.

#### Method 3: HTML Source Code[¶](#method-3-html-source-code "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Lastly, you can check the HTML source code, though this method is not as
reliable as the previous two and is less preferred.

[![!](../images/ts-optimize12.png)](../images/ts-optimize12.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

In this example, you can see the `Unclosed block` error displayed in the
spot where your Critical CSS should have been inserted.

#### Find the Original CSS File[¶](#find-the-original-css-file "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Regardless of the method used, you probably discovered something like
this:

::: highlight
        /*CssSyntaxError: /wp-content/litespeed/cssjs/5aaa0.css:1:1: Unclosed block*/
`/wp-content/litespeed/cssjs/5aaa0.css` is the file that causes the
problem, but this is not the original CSS file. Any file that you find
inside of the `/wp-content/litespeed/` directory is one that has been
generated by the LiteSpeed Cache plugin.

In this case, it is an optimized CSS file generated through the **CSS
Combine** and/or **CSS Minify** features. You cannot fix the syntax
error in a generated file. You need to fix it at the source.

To find the original source CSS you will need to turn off optimization
and check again.

1.  Navigate to **Page Optimization \> CSS** and set **CSS combine** to
    `OFF` and **CSS Minify** to `OFF`. Save your changes.
    [![!](../images/ts-optimize13.png)](../images/ts-optimize13.png){.glightbox
    data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
    desc-position="bottom"}
2.  Navigate to **Toolbox \> Purge** and perform a **Purge All** and a
    **Purge All - CCSS**, or do it from the Admin Bar as shown.
    [![!](../images/ts-optimize14.png)](../images/ts-optimize14.png){.glightbox
    data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
    desc-position="bottom"}
3.  Visit the web page so that the CCSS is regenerated.
4.  Use whichever method you used the first time to re-check the CCSS
    and look for the syntax error.
    [![!](../images/ts-optimize15.png)](../images/ts-optimize15.png){.glightbox
    data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
    desc-position="bottom"}

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

CCSS generation has a time limit to avoid server overload. If you can\'t
get your CCSS to regenerate right away, please wait for few minutes and
then try again.
Once CCSS has regenerated, your error checking should reveal something
like the following:

::: highlight
        /*CssSyntaxError: /wp-includes/css/dist/block-library/style.min.css:1:1: Unclosed block*/
This is much more useful to you, as it is the original CSS file that you
should be able to fix yourself. Or, at least, you should be able to
contact the theme author or plugin author who provided the file to you.

If you\'re not sure where the CSS came from, the file name should give
you a hint. If it was from a plugin, the path should look like
`/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name/path/file.css`. A theme\'s CSS should
look something like `/wp-content/themes/theme-name/path/file.css`.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

For the purpose of illustrating the issue, we deliberately sabotaged a
WordPress default CSS file to trigger a syntax error. Normally,
`/wp-includes/css/dist/block-library/style.min.css` would not be a
problematic file.
### UCSS Not Generating[¶](#ucss-not-generating "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Visit your Dashboard at my.quic.cloud to see the status of your online
services, including Unique CSS. Click your domain name, then Page
Optimization, and then the UCSS tab. If there is a UCSS generation
error, you'll see it here.

The error message usually indicates that UCSS has failed due to a syntax
error in the source CSS code.

To fix an error like this, you will need to find the problematic source
CSS file, fix the syntax error, and then generate UCSS again. Let's walk
through that process:

#### Find the problematic source CSS[¶](#find-the-problematic-source-css "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Start by visiting the page in your browser, and then select **View page
source** from the left-click menu.

Near the top of the page, there should be a link to the
LiteSpeed-generated CSS file. This is the file that contains all of the
page's combined and minified CSS. It is the file that is sent to
QUIC.cloud for processing. So if QUIC.cloud found an error, it would be
in this file. Click the link to open the file.

You'll know you are in the right place because the first line will say
`This file is auto-generated`. Use CTRL-F or Command F to search for the
code snippet mentioned in the error message. 

Once you find it, look at the rest of the CSS code around it. The names
of the CSS selectors should help you deduce what original CSS source
file contains the error. At the very least, it should help you narrow it
down to a particular plugin's CSS files, and you can search through
those for the error. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to demonstrate
this. It's going to be different for every site and for every error.

#### Fix or exclude the syntax error[¶](#fix-or-exclude-the-syntax-error "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Once you figure out where the original source came from, you will need
to fix the CSS syntax error in that source file. If you can't fix it
yourself, you can exclude the source CSS file from optimization. To do
so, navigate to **Page Optimization \> Tuning - CSS** and add the file
name to the **UCSS File Excludes and Inline** list.

#### Generate UCSS again[¶](#generate-ucss-again "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Once the source CSS file is either fixed or excluded, hover over the
LiteSpeed icon in the WordPress Admin Bar and click **Purge All**. This
will purge both the cache, and any combined or minified CSS. Then hover
again, and click **Purge All - UCSS** to have generated UCSS files
purged.

Go back to your site and reload the page. This will trigger a request to
generate a new UCSS file. If you have time to wait, you can skip the
next step, and the UCSS will be automatically generated via the cron.

Otherwise, to jump start UCSS generation, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache
\> Page Optimization \> CSS Settings** and look for the queue displayed
under the **Generate UCSS** setting. Run the queue manually.

Go back to the QUIC.cloud Dashboard and check the UCSS status. You
should see the file has been generated again, this time without any
syntax error.

### Incomplete UCSS[¶](#incomplete-ucss "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Sometimes UCSS is generated without some necessary CSS selectors,
resulting in a distorted display. This is usually because such selectors
require user interaction, and are not visible to the UCSS generator.

In such cases, if you find the missing CSS selectors and add them to the
[**UCSS Allowlist** box](../pageopt/#generate-ucss), you can solve the
problem. Execute the following steps to find the relevent CSS selectors
and allowlist them.

::: {.admonition .warning}
Important First Step for Guest Mode Users

If you have *not explicitly enabled UCSS*, and you are only using UCSS
as part of the Guest Mode + Guest Optimization feature, then you will
need to temporarily force LSCWP to use Guest Mode and Guest Optimization
for all visits from your IP address. To do so, navigate to **LiteSpeed
Cache \> General \> Tuning** and add your local IP address to the
**Guest Mode IPs** list.
1.  Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization \> Tuning - CSS**
    where the **UCSS Allowlist** field can be found. Leave the page open
    there.
2.  Visit your website in a separate window, and have the developer
    tools visible. The problems in your website\'s display should be
    visible in this window. We\'ll call this **Window A**.
3.  Open another window with developer tools visible. This time visit
    your site, but append the `/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm` string to the
    end. For example,
    `https://www.yoursite.com/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm`. This will
    display your site without any of the optimizations, and it should
    look correct to you. We\'ll call this **Window B**.
4.  In Window A, right click your mouse over the problematic area of the
    page and select **Inspect** from the menu.
5.  Do the same in Window B.
6.  Compare the contents of the two Inspect windows, line by line. Look
    for any selector that appears in Window B\'s Inspect detail but does
    not appear in Window A\'s Inspect detail.
7.  Copy the missing selector and paste it into the **UCSS Allowlist**
    box.
8.  Repeat the previous two steps until you have found every missing
    selector from the problematic area(s) of the website.
9.  When you\'ve finished adding selectors to the **UCSS Allowlist**,
    press the **Save Changes** button.
10. From the WP-Admin Admin Bar at the top of the screen, hover over the
    LiteSpeed Cache symbol, and then click **Purge All**. Hover over the
    symbol again and click **Purge All - UCSS**.
11. Return to your website in Window A, and reload the page. This will
    trigger a request to generate a new UCSS file.
12. If you have time to wait, you can skip the next two steps, and the
    UCSS will be automatically generated via the cron.
13. To jump start UCSS generation, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page
    Optimization \> CSS Settings** and look for the queue displayed
    under the **Generate UCSS** setting. Run the queue manually.
14. Navigate to the LiteSpeed Cache **Dashboard**, find the queue
    displayed with **Unique CSS** and click **Force cron**. Wait a few
    minutes for UCSS to generate.
15. Return to your website in Window A, and reload the page again. This
    time, the new UCSS file should be in use, and you should see an
    improvement in the display.
16. If you see some improvement but there are still areas that are
    problematic, repeat the process: compare the two Inspect displays
    for Window A and Window B, and allowlist all of the problematic CSS
    selectors.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Don\'t Forget

If you added your local IP address to the **Guest Mode IPs** list
previously, remove it now and press the **Save Changes** button.
### Bypass Optimization in AJAX[¶](#bypass-optimization-in-ajax "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have a conflict, and you need to bypass optimization functions in
AJAX, you can either add some code to your theme\'s `functions.php`, or
you can call the appropriate filter when using AJAX.

#### In the Theme\'s Functions[¶](#in-the-themes-functions "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Add the following to your theme\'s `functions.php` file:
`defined( 'DOING_AJAX' ) && add_filter( 'litespeed_can_optm', '__return_false' );`

#### Call the Filter[¶](#call-the-filter "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

When using AJAX, you can call the above filter, and return false.

### DevTools Failed to Load SourceMap[¶](#devtools-failed-to-load-sourcemap "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Chrome may show a message like the following in it\'s developer tools:

::: highlight
    DevTools failed to load SourceMap: Could not load content for https://example.com/wp-content/litespeed/cssjs/xxxx.js.map: HTTP error: status code 404 , net :: ERR_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE
Do not worry, this is absolutely normal. The tool is trying to load the
resources map for a minified JS or CSS file, so that it may be
unminified. Of course, this file doesn\'t exist, so it returns a 404
error.

[![!Developer Tools
Configuration](../images/ts-optimize16.png)](../images/ts-optimize16.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

You may ignore this error. It will NOT affect your site in any way.
