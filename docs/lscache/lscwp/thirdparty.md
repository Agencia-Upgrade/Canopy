## Confirmed Compatible[¶](#confirmed-compatible "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This is a list of known popular plugins and themes that we have checked
for compatibility. All of the products listed here were compatible with
LSCache at the time of testing. If this list looks small, it is because
we only test those plugins that have the potential to conflict with a
cache solution. **Most WordPress plugins can be used with LiteSpeed
Cache with no problems whatsoever.**

Many of the plugins/themes listed below work with LSCWP right out of the
box, but others require some action before they will work. Please note
the **Action Required** column.

## Untested Plugins[¶](#untested-plugins "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

It\'s impossible to list every plugin that is compatible with LiteSpeed
Cache, so here is a rule of thumb:

If the plugin is not a cache plugin or an optimization plugin, and it
doesn't generate site content, or do anything out of the ordinary with
existing front-end content, then chances are it is 100% compatible with
LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress. (The vast majority of plugins fall into
this category.)

Still note sure? Consider these points:

- LSCWP purges pages from the cache when certain events are triggered.
  If your plugin generates content that triggers those same events, then
  it\'s compatible in that area.
- LSCWP follows a set of rules to determine whether a page is cacheable.
  If your plugin generates content that also abides by those same rules,
  then it\'s compatible in that area.
- If the plugin uses a
  [nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces), customization
  may be required. Please [see our API](../api)
- If the plugin claims to speed up your site, then it probably has
  duplicate functionality and will likely conflict with LiteSpeed Cache.

If you still are unsure, you can ask the plugin author if they have
tested for LiteSpeed compatibility, or you can test it yourself.

### Testing For Compatibility[¶](#testing-for-compatibility "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

We\'ve tried to make these instruction as easy to understand as
possible. **You don\'t need to be a developer** in order to test for
compatibility between two plugins.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

While you *could* perform these tests on a production site, we recommend
using a test WordPress installation if you have one. This allows you to
really take your time, and follow the steps carefully. Testing
compatibility is not *hard*, per se, but it is helpful if you can do it
without the added pressure of having your production environment
effectively offline for the duration of the test.
In whichever environment you are using (test or production) [verify that
LSCache for WordPress is
working](../installation/#verify-your-site-is-being-cached) as desired
before activating the other plugin. Once you have it the way you want
it, you may proceed with testing as outlined below.

Since it\'s cumbersome to keep saying \"the plugin you want to test,\"
let\'s call it \"ThatPlugin\" for this example.

#### Deactivate[¶](#deactivate "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Deactivate all plugins except for LSCache and ThatPlugin from the
WordPress **Plugins** screen, like so:

[![!](../images/thirdparty01.png)](../images/thirdparty01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Plugins**, and click the
checkbox next to the **Plugins** column as shown. All of the plugins
will be checked. Un-check the boxes next to LiteSpeed Cache and
ThatPlugin. Select `Deactivate` from the dropdown **Bulk Actions** box,
and click the **Apply** button. All plugins, aside from LSCache and
ThatPlugin will be disabled.

Also, be sure that you are using a theme that is compatible with
LSCache. If you are not sure about your theme, temporarily switch to the
default WordPress theme: Navigate to **Appearance \> Themes**, hover
over the appropriate card, and press the **Activate** button.

#### Purge[¶](#purge "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Purge the cache: Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \> Purge** and
press the **Purge All** button.

#### Run Tests[¶](#run-tests "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This step varies, depending on how you use ThatPlugin, and what it needs
to be able to do. Run through your most common scenarios, and after each
step, verify that ThatPlugin is working as expected. Additionally,
[check to see if the relevant pages are properly
cached](../installation/#verify-your-site-is-being-cached).

If ThatPlugin deals with any private information, run the through the
steps twice: once logged-in, and once in incognito mode. When you visit
the site incognito, be sure that you are not seeing any private
information from your previous logged-in session.

##### Some Testing Examples[¶](#some-testing-examples "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

- If ThatPlugin is a forum plugin, run through the steps of creating an
  account, updating your profile, publishing a post, and submitting a
  comment. Check the cache at every step.
- If ThatPlugin is a social sharing plugin that counts shares, use it to
  share a post or a page to social media and then verify that the share
  count has increased.
- If ThatPlugin is a contact form plugin, use it to send yourself some
  feedback. Visit the form page again while not logged in, and verify
  that you are not seeing any of your previous logged-in information.

#### Document + Report[¶](#document-report "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you encounter an issue that indicates the plugins are not working
well together, document it. Take a screenshot, or copy the text of any
error messages you may get. Visit the [LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress
support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/litespeed-cache) and
share as many details as possible, including the above screenshots.

It might also be helpful to include a copy of your Environment Report so
that the support team can see your system settings. To do so, navigate
to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \> Report** and click the **Send to
LiteSpeed** button. Then make note of the **Report Number** and include
it with your forum post.

If you have the skills, you can take a look at [our API](../api) and
make the plugin compatible yourself!

#### Reactivate[¶](#reactivate "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Once you are satisfied that everything works well, or you have
documented and reported anything that doesn\'t, you may re-activate all
of the plugins, and restore your preferred theme.

### A Note About Themes[¶](#a-note-about-themes "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Sometimes the plugins all get along well, but there is something
unexpected happening in the theme. To test theme compatibility, follow
the same steps as above, with the following differences:

- LiteSpeed Cache should be the only active plugin
- The theme you want to test should be activated

## Known Plugin Work Arounds[¶](#known-plugin-work-arounds "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

Any changes you make directly to plugin files as a result of these
work-arounds will be lost the next time you update the plugin. Take care
to preserve your updates locally, or contact the plugin author and
request their help in making the work-around native to the plugin.
### WP-Postviews[¶](#wp-postviews "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Use

::: highlight
    <div id="postviews_lscwp"></div>
to replace

::: highlight
    <?php if(function_exists('the_views')) { the_views(); } ?>
Replace the ajax query in
`wp-content/plugins/wp-postviews/postviews-cache.js` with

::: highlight
    jQuery.ajax({ type:"GET", url:viewsCacheL10n.admin_ajax_url,
         data:"postviews_id="+viewsCacheL10n.post_id+"&action=postviews",
         cache:!1, success:function(data) { 
         if(data) { jQuery('#postviews_lscwp').html(data+' views'); } } });
Purge the cache to use the updated pages.

### Duplicator Pro[¶](#duplicator-pro "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Add the following code to your cache root .htaccess file:

::: highlight
    # BEGIN LiteSpeed noabort
    <IfModule rewrite_module>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule (wp-cron|duplicator-pro-main|duplicator-pro)\.php - [E=noabort:1]
    </IfModule>
    # END liteSpeed noabort
### Contact Form 7[¶](#contact-form-7 "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you want to add a custom value to a CF7 form field via JavaScript,
you must add the following before your code:

::: highlight
    wpcf7.cached = false
CF7\'s default behavior is to reset all forms on load when cache is
enabled. When that happens, any changes made via JavaScript are lost.
The above code prevents the form from resetting.

### Elementor[¶](#elementor "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LSCWP is compatible with the Elementor site builder, though there are
some settings that we recommend changing for the best performance.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

As always, we recommend you thoroughly test your site before going live
with any optimization setting changes.
::: {.admonition .note}
Note

The Elementor plugin navigation was verified accurate as of this
writing. Please see [Elementor\'s Help
Center](https://elementor.com/help/) if you can\'t find a specified
setting.
In the Elementor **Settings**, navigate to the **Performance** tab and
set the following values:

- **CSS Print Method**: we recommend not changing this if the frontend
  is working as expected.
- **Optimized Image Loading**: `Disable`
- **Optimized Gutenberg Loading**: `Enable`

Navigate to the **Features** tab and set the following values:

- **Inline Font Icons**: `Active`
- **Additional Custom Breakpoints**: `Inactive`
- **Lazy Load Background Images**: `Inactive`

With these settings made, you should be able to use LiteSpeed\'s [page
optimizations](../pageopt/) (CSS and JavaScript Minification and
Combination settings, as well as Lazy Loading and Image Placeholders)
without conflicting with any of Elementor\'s optimizations.

Tip

If you are experiencing broken layouts or functionality due to CSS or
JavaScript optimizations, see our [Troubleshooting
documentation](../ts-optimize)
