## First Steps[¶](#first-steps "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### Verify it\'s an LSCache Issue[¶](#verify-its-an-lscache-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

1.  LSCache plugin should be activated
2.  LSCache should be enabled
3.  Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \> Debug Settings** and set
    **Disable All Features** to `ON`

Are you still having a problem? Then it is probably *not an LSCache
plugin issue*.

Is the issue gone? Then the issue *is probably related to the LSCache
plugin*.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

You might also try viewing an uncached version or an unoptimized version
of the page using [Admin IP Commands](../admin/#admin-ip-commands).

- Uncached: `https://example.com/?LSCWP_CTRL=NOCACHE`
- Unoptimized: `https://example.com/?LSCWP_CTRL=before_optm`
### Check your LSCWP Version[¶](#check-your-lscwp-version "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Our LSCWP plugin is developed at a fast pace. Some issues may have
already been fixed in the latest version. You should always upgrade to
the latest version before spending resources on any issue.

### Pinpoint the Problem[¶](#pinpoint-the-problem "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Using the default settings, LiteSpeed Cache does *not* apply any
optimizations, and does *not* alter any page content. So, it is likely
that one of the settings you have enabled has caused the issue. In order
to pinpoint that setting, the first thing you\'ll need to do is go back
to the defaults:

1.  [Export your current settings as a
    backup](../toolbox/#export-settings)
2.  [Reset LSCache to its default
    settings](../toolbox/#reset-all-settings)

If the site is still broken with the default settings, please [contact
our support team](../#additional-support). However, if the site works
fine with the default settings, that confirms that an option you had
enabled is causing the issue.

In order to find the problematic setting, you must re-enable each of
your previous settings one-by-one until you find the one that breaks
your site.

With each new setting you enable, be sure to **[Purge
All](../toolbox/#purge-all)**, and refresh the browser. When the issue
comes back, you know you\'ve found the problematic setting.

::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

**Purge All** does not purge Critical CSS, Unique CSS, or Low-Quality
Image Previews. If you are testing features related to CCSS, UCSS, or
LQIP you will also need to **Purge All - Critical CSS**, **Purge All -
Unique CSS**, or **Purge All - LQIP Cache**, respectively. Just keep in
mind that CCSS, UCSS, and LQIP are QUIC.cloud services that may cost
money to regenerate after purging.
When you begin re-enabling settings, the following rules of thumb can
help you decide the best place to start:

- If certain functionality or buttons have stopped working, it\'s likely
  an issue with JavaScript Optimization.
- If pages are rendering badly, then it\'s likely an issue with CSS
  Optimization.
- If images aren\'t loading properly, then it\'s likely an issue with
  Media Optimization.

### Get a Report Number[¶](#get-a-report-number "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have been through this Troubleshooting Guide, and you still
require support, we may ask to see your Environment Report. The
Environment Report tells us what settings you have enabled, what other
plugins you have installed, and the contents of your `.htaccess` file,
among other useful things.

To generate and share your Environment Report, navigate to **LiteSpeed
Cache \> Toolbox \> Report**, scroll down and press the **Send to
LiteSpeed** button. Make note of the **Report Number** that is
generated, and include it in your support request so that we may look it
up on our end.

### Turn On the Debug Log[¶](#turn-on-the-debug-log "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .help}
Video

See a video demonstration of **Debug LSCWP with the Debug Log**
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGuk85gwQc8).
In some situations, it may be helpful to see the WordPress debug log.
Because it has the potential to take up a lot of disk space, debug
logging is disabled by default. To enable it, navigate to **Toolbox \>
Debug Settings** and set **Debug Log** to `ON` or to `Admin IP Only`.
Set **Debug Level** to `Advanced` and press the **Save Changes** button.

You can check the generated log by navigating to the **Log View** tab,
and pressing the **Debug Log** button.

If you prefer to enable and monitor the debug log from the command line,
you can modify `wp-config.php` under WordPress\' root directory as
follows:

1.  Set `WP_DEBUG` to true: `define('WP_DEBUG',true);`
2.  Add the following: `define('WP_DEBUG_LOG',true);`

A `debug.log` file will be generated under the `wp-content` directory,
and will log information whenever WordPress hits the backend.

You can monitor this log during debugging using the following command:

::: highlight
    tail -f wp-content/debug.log
Be sure to disable logging when you no longer need it.

## LiteSpeed Cache is Disabled[¶](#litespeed-cache-is-disabled "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you see a warning that indicates LiteSpeed Cache is disabled, the
warning itself may give a clue as to the source of the problem.

### Disabled at Server Level[¶](#disabled-at-server-level "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

`The LSCache Module is disabled at the server level`

This indicates that cache is turned off at the highest level. You will
need to [configure your server](../#server-level-prerequisites), or have
your hosting provider do it for you.

### Disabled in Plugin Settings[¶](#disabled-in-plugin-settings "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

`LiteSpeed Cache is disabled in the plugin settings`

This indicates that you haven\'t turned on caching in the plugin
settings. [Do so](../cache/#enable-cache), and the problem should be
solved.

### Just Plain Disabled[¶](#just-plain-disabled "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

`LiteSpeed Cache is disabled`

This is a generic error that doesn\'t indicate any cause. Navigate to
**LiteSpeed Cache \> Toolbox \> Report** and look at the **Report
Summary**. The `Server Variables` section right at the top can give you
some helpful information. Check the value of `LITESPEED_ON`. It should
be `true`.

If this value is `NULL`, it means that you are not running with
LiteSpeed Web Server. This is allowed, but it limits the functions that
you are able to use. [Learn
more](../installation/#without-a-litespeed-server).

## LiteSpeed Returns `no-cache`[¶](#litespeed-returns-no-cache "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If a page that should be cached is repeatedly returning `no-cache`,
first check whether it\'s been explicitly excluded: Navigate to **Cache
\> Excludes** and check all of the settings. Is your page listed in **Do
Not Cache URIs**? Or maybe it\'s in a category or tag that has been
excluded?

If you don\'t see anything in the **Exclude** settings that should
affect your page, [check the debug log](#turn-on-the-debug-log). When a
page is excluded from cache, you should be able to find the reason in
the log. This is an example of a line from a debug log for the page
`https://example.com/summer-berry-scone-recipe/`, which was returning
`no-cache`:

::: highlight
    10/26/22 19:28:01.748 [108.5.103.76:56172 1 lCD] [Ctrl] X Cache_control off - Admin configured URI Do not cache: scone
The log indicates that the page was not cached because the **Do Not
Cache URIs** setting included the string `scone`. That setting prevents
any page with the word `scone` in the URL from being cached.

## WordPress Lacks Permissions[¶](#wordpress-lacks-permissions "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If WordPress doesn\'t have access to create tables in your database,
please run these SQL queries manually after installation:

::: highlight
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wp_litespeed_optimizer (
    id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    hash_name varchar(60) NOT NULL COMMENT “hash.filetype”,
    src text NOT NULL COMMENT “full url array set”,
    dateline int(11) NOT NULL,
    refer varchar(255) NOT NULL COMMENT “The container page url”,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    UNIQUE KEY hash_name (hash_name),
    KEY dateline (dateline)
    );
and

::: highlight
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `wp_litespeed_img_optm` (
      `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `post_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `optm_status` varchar(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `src` varchar(1000) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `srcpath_md5` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `src_md5` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `server` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `root_id` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `src_filesize` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `target_filesize` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `target_saved` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `webp_filesize` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `webp_saved` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
      UNIQUE KEY `post_id_2` (`post_id`,`srcpath_md5`),
      KEY `post_id` (`post_id`),
      KEY `optm_status` (`optm_status`),
      KEY `root_id` (`root_id`),
      KEY `src_md5` (`src_md5`),
      KEY `srcpath_md5` (`srcpath_md5`)
      );
::: {.admonition .note}
Note

If your site uses a table prefix other than `wp_`, please replace the
`wp_` in `wp_litespeed_optimizer` and `wp_litespeed_img_optm` with your
site\'s prefix.
## Unable to Save Changes in WP-Admin[¶](#unable-to-save-changes-in-wp-admin "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you are unable to save your settings in WP-Admin, or the options are
reset to their previous state after refreshing the page, there are a few
possible explanations.

### Accidental Caching[¶](#accidental-caching "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

WP-Admin may be cached by browser cache or opcode cache. To see if this
is the case, check the response headers, like so:

[![!Page is not
cached](../images/troubleshoot01.png)](../images/troubleshoot01.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

1.  From a non-logged-in browser, navigate to the page, open the
    **Network** tab in the developer tools, refresh the page, and click
    the first listed resource. This should be the URI of the page, as
    described above.
2.  Look for two headings:
    - `cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`
    - `expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT` (the value may be set to
      any date *prior to* today) If either of those headers is not
      present, or has a different value, the browser is likely caching
      your page. Typically, browser caching is accidentally enabled via
      bad optimization rules that add the cache control header to
      dynamic requests. Check your `.htaccess` file to fix this.
3.  If you have opcache enabled, please disable it and see if that
    helps. You can use the `phpinfo` page to verify.
4.  If you have an additional cache layer, particularly object cache
    with Redis or Memcached, please try disabling that.

### Database Corruption[¶](#database-corruption "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If the LiteSpeed Cache plugin\'s database structure is corrupted or
damaged, it could cause this behavior. It\'s rare that this will happen,
but if it does, you may repair it with the following steps:

1.  Back up your current database.
2.  Disable the LiteSpeed Cache plugin.
3.  Create a PHP file named `repair.php` in same directory as your
    `wp-config.php`. Copy the following contents into `repair.php`:

    ::: highlight
        <?php
        define( 'WP_USE_THEMES', false );
        require( './wp-load.php' );

        global $wpdb;
        $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . 'options';
        $table_name = "{$wpdb->prefix}options";
        $wpdb->query( $wpdb->prepare( "DELETE FROM `$table_name` WHERE `option_name` like '%litespeed.%' " ) );


        if ( defined( 'LSCWP_V' ) ) {
        do_action( 'litespeed_purge_all' );
        }
        echo "done";
    :::
4.  Visit `https://example.com/repair.php`, replacing `example.com` with
    your actual domain. It should output \"done.\"
5.  Delete `repair.php`, and re-enable the LiteSpeed Cache plugin. The
    database will be freshly created, and should work fine now.

## Admin Bar is Missing[¶](#admin-bar-is-missing "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The Admin Bar at the top of the page should display on the frontend for
logged in users.

Immediately after logging in, if the admin bar does not display until
you manually refresh the page, this could be due to the **Instant
Click** setting.

Here\'s why: When you enable **Instant Click** via **LiteSpeed Cache \>
Cache \> Advanced**, some themes will prefetch the home page content
*before* logging you in. As a result, the prefetched version from
browser cache does not include the admin bar.

To verify that this is what is happening, turn on the browser developer
tools, check the HTTP response header for the login page request. Make
sure the **Disable Cache** option in the tool is *not* selected. The
HTTP response header should show the status code `200` with
`(from Prefetch Cache)` appended. If you see this, it confirms that
**Instant Click** is the problem.

Solution: Turn off **Instant Click** when using an incompatible theme.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

This behavior occurs with Chrome and Microsoft Edge, but not Firefox.
## LSCache Directory Too Big[¶](#lscache-directory-too-big "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your `lscache` directory is growing too quickly, it could be due to
multiple requests from crawlers or bots using different query strings.

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

You may get requests every second from Facebook with the user-agent
`facebookexternalhit` or `facebot`, and each request uses a different
query string.
To mitigate this behavior, check your access log to identify the
user-agent, and try one of the following solutions:

- If Facebook is the culprit, follow their [official
  guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting)
  to enable rate limiting
- Exclude the offending
  [user-agents](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/cache/#do-not-cache-user-agents)
  from cache.
- If you don\'t care about the service the user-agent is providing
  (analytics, etc), then you can set a [rewrite rule to block the
  user-agent](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/access.html#blocking-of-robots)
  directly
- Enable a workaround and set a [cron
  job](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/basics/#cron-job) to clean
  up the `lscache` folder regularly.

## Caching Issues[¶](#caching-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### Forced Caching[¶](#forced-caching "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Sometimes, in an effort to make sure that certain pages are always
cached, you erroneously force the *entire site* to be cached. This is
not a good idea, because you never know when there will be individual
exceptions to caching.

Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \> Cache** and look in the
**Force Cache URIs** box. If you see `/` or `*` there, then you will
need to remove it. Save, and then **Purge All LSCache**.

### Logged-in Users Appearing as Logged-out[¶](#logged-in-users-appearing-as-logged-out "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

This problem is caused when using multiple web applications under a
single domain. You can find more information on this issue and how to
resolve it in our [Handling Logged-in Cookie Conflicts
documentation](../../troubleshoot/#logged-in-cookie-conflicts).

### Cache Always Misses[¶](#cache-always-misses "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you always see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss` in the headers, then
something is wrong. Disable and then re-enable LSCache. Does that help?
If not, take a look at the following scenarios and see if they apply to
your site:

#### Check permissions[¶](#check-permissions "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Verify that the cache directory has the proper permissions (`0755`). If
you don\'t know your [cache root directory](../#configure-the-server),
your hosting provider can help.

#### Check your CDN[¶](#check-your-cdn "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Some CDNs have cache settings that can break LSCache and cause
`X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss` to appear at all times. However, accessing the
backend server directly achieves `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit`. If this
happens, turn off the CDN\'s cache functions.

#### Check your file path[¶](#check-your-file-path "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your domain path and your file path are different then LSCache will
be looking in the wrong place for your `.htacess` file.

Add the following lines to `wp-config.php`, replacing `/domain_path/`
with the actual path where your site\'s frontend `.htacess` is located,
and `/file_path/` with the actual path where your site\'s backend
`.htaccess` is located:

::: highlight
    define("LITESPEED_CFG_HTACCESS", "/domain_path/.htaccess");
    define("LITESPEED_CFG_HTACCESS_BACKEND", "/file_path/.htaccess");
::: {.admonition .example}
Example

If the files for your `https://www.example.com` site are stored in a
`/wordpress/` subdirectory, your domain path might look like
`/home/user/public_html/.htaccess` while your file path would look like
`/home/user/public_html/worpdress/.htaccess`.
### Browser Displays Stale Content[¶](#browser-displays-stale-content "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Scenario: older cached versions of updated pages are being served.
You\'ve checked the response headers for the `X-LiteSpeed-Cache` line,
and it is not found. This indicates that the page is not coming from
LiteSpeed\'s cache, even though it should be.

#### Cause[¶](#cause "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The page is being served from the browser cache due to cache rules
present in `.htaccess` (most likely in the WordPress root directory).

If `.htaccess` contains an `ExpiresDefault` cache rule, or an
`ExpiresByType text/html` cache rule that is not set to `0` seconds, the
copy stored by the browser cache will be served. *The page will never be
requested from LiteSpeed*. Because the browser cache lacks the advanced
purging rules that are the backbone of LiteSpeed\'s accuracy, this can
result in stale content being served.

#### Solution[¶](#solution "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have no other cache plugins installed, and you have no interest
in using a browser cache, then you can safely remove any of the
`ExpiresDefault` or `ExpiresByType` lines.

If you want to leave the existing browser caching functionality in
place, you\'ll need to specifically exclude the pages that are handled
by LiteSpeed Cache. Add the following line above the `ExpiresDefault`
line:

::: highlight
        ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 0 seconds"
If the `ExpiresByType text/html` rule already exists, edit it so that it
matches the line above.

This rule will make it so that the pages that are cached by LSCWP are
not included in the browser cache, but any other browser-cache behavior
will remain unchanged.

### PHP Session Issues[¶](#php-session-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Some plugins, such as WHMpress, that use **PHP Session** to store values
(currency, language\...etc) don\'t work with LiteSpeed Cache. Once
LiteSpeed Cache is enabled, user-dependent values like currency do not
work or display correctly.

#### Cause[¶](#cause_1 "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#cause_1}

Pages whose content depends on **PHP Session** are not cache-friendly.
Once the cached page is generated, it will *not* vary on session data.

Why? LiteSpeed Cache is designed to avoid hitting the PHP backend.
Therefore, there is no way for the cache module to know what value is
stored in **PHP Session** for any visitor other than the first one to
load the page.

#### Solution:[¶](#solution_1 "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#solution_1}

To make this to work, a code change to the third party plugin is
required. The developer can change the plugin to store the value in a
cookie and then LiteSpeed Cache can be set to [vary on that
cookie](../../devguide/advanced/#cache-varies).

### Cache Purges Too Frequently[¶](#cache-purges-too-frequently "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Scenario: the cache is getting purged quite often, inconsistent with the
TTL settings. Some actions may unintentionally trigger a purge, and it
may be necessary to do some investigation to find the culprit.

#### Possible Explanations[¶](#possible-explanations "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

1.  **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \> Purge**: Have you enabled `All pages`,
    and you post frequently?
2.  **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \> Purge**: Have you manually added any
    hooks to **Purge All Hooks**?
3.  Do you have any plugins that are automatically enabled or disabled
    when a page loads?

All of these things will cause a **Purge All** action. If you can
disable any of them, that should solve the problem.

#### Diagnosing the Problem[¶](#diagnosing-the-problem "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If the cause is not obvious, you\'ll need to do a little digging. Enable
the debug log, repeat the steps that cause a purge, disable logging, and
then check the log to find the cause of any **Purge All** actions.

##### Enable LSCWP Debug Log[¶](#enable-lscwp-debug-log "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Navigate to **Toolbox \> Debug** and set **Debug Log** to
`Admin IP only`. Add your IP address under **Admin IPs** (`192.0.2.0` in
this example), and set **Debug Level** to `Advanced`.

[![!](../images/troubleshoot02.png)](../images/troubleshoot02.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

##### Reproduce the Issue[¶](#reproduce-the-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Execute the following steps:

- **Purge All - LSCache**
- Access any page twice
- Make sure the cache header is showing `hit`
- Reproduce the steps that are suspected of triggering a purge.

In this example, let\'s assume you have noticed unusual purging activity
when you edit a WooCommerce product\'s inventory. The steps your would
reproduce in this case are: visit home page, edit product, visit home
page again.

##### Check the Debug Log[¶](#check-the-debug-log "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

LiteSpeed Cache is a tag-based caching system, so in order to figure out
what is happening, you should search for the appropriate tags in the
debug log. First, we look for `X-LiteSpeed-Tag` to find the pages that
are impacted. We find the following lines, which correspond to home
page, edit product, home page:

::: highlight
    X-LiteSpeed-Tag: 87f1_URL.6666cd76f96956469e7be39d750cc7d9,87f1_F,87f1_Po.24,87f1_PGS,87f1_
    X-LiteSpeed-Tag: 87f1_tag_priv,public:87f1_ESI,public:87f1_ESI.admin-bar,public:87f1_
    X-LiteSpeed-Tag: 87f1_URL.6666cd76f96956469e7be39d750cc7d9,87f1_F,87f1_Po.24,87f1_PGS,87f1_
Then we search for `X-LiteSpeed-Purge` to find the purge action. We find
the following lines:

::: highlight
    X-LiteSpeed-Purge: public,87f1_WC_T.18

Here\'s how it works: if the tag(s) in `X-LiteSpeed-Purge` is/are
contained in the `X-LiteSpeed-Tag` of other pages, then those other
pages will be purged during the action.

Now let\'s check the above tags. We will see:

`87f1_F` and `87f1_PGS` are contained by the homepage, so it gets
purged. `87f1` is the prefix. `F` stands for Front Page, and `PGS`
stands for Pages. You can see a full list of tag classes [in the
code](https://github.com/litespeedtech/lscache_wp/blob/6f3e5bd70db78e1900a8ba0c68765c7257534f5c/litespeed-cache/inc/tag.class.php#L17),
if you wish.

#### Solution[¶](#solution_2 "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#solution_2}

`F` and `PGS` are triggered by the setting **Auto Purge Rules For
Publish/Update**. If you do not want the `Front page` or `Pages` to be
purged every time you update a WooCommerce item, then you need to
uncheck those options.

#### Disable auto purge[¶](#disable-auto-purge "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

This is a last resort, for sites that do not actively or frequently
update the content. If you disable auto purge, you MUST purge the cache
manually any time content on your site changes, or you run the risk of
serving stale content.
You can disable auto purge by adding the following code to your theme\'s
`functions.php` file:

::: highlight
    if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "LSCWP_NONCE") === false){
    ob_start( function($buffer){
    @header('X-LiteSpeed-Purge: nothing');
    return $buffer;
    } );
    }
### Page Content Not Updating Correctly[¶](#page-content-not-updating-correctly "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If your site uses a plugin that updates the content of a page without
editing/saving that page, such as a \"like\" button that updates a
counter when pressed using ajax, LSCache will not be made aware that the
page should be purged from cache. As long as the now outdated copy of
the page is still in cache and being served, it will appear like these
changes never happened.

#### Solution[¶](#solution_3 "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#solution_3}

Add our `litespeed_purge_post($pid)` [API
call](../api/#purge-a-single-post-by-id) to the offending plugin to have
it notify LSCache that the page should be purged.

#### Testing[¶](#testing "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

1.  Purge the cache and with the inspector open (right click page \>
    **Inspect**) access the page as a guest/non-logged in user.
2.  In the inspector, click into the **Network** tab and select the page
    request - this is usually the first entry. With this selected, click
    the **Header** tab and check that the **Response Header** does not
    contain `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit`.
3.  (If your plugin updates on each visit, skip this step) Refresh the
    page. You should now see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` in your response
    header. This indicates that the page was served from cache.
4.  Trigger your plugin and make sure that the page is updated as
    expected.
5.  Refresh the page one last time. `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` should once
    again be gone from the Response Header and the page should still
    contain the updated information.

## WP-Cron Issues[¶](#wp-cron-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### A Scheduled Event has Failed[¶](#a-scheduled-event-has-failed "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The following notice may appear in the Health Check plugin:
`The scheduled event, litespeed_xxxx[image or ccss]_trigger, failed to run, Your site still works, but this may indicate that scheduling posts or automated updates may not work as intended`

For example:

::: highlight
    The scheduled event, litespeed_imgoptm_trigger, failed to run.
Technically, this is not a LiteSpeed issue, but is due to WordPress
itself. This usually happens when WP does a version update. It will
usually clear up on its own in a day or so, once the WP-Cron is back to
normal.

If you don\'t want to wait, you can disable WP-Cron and use a 3^rd^
party cron like cPanel cron.

### Scheduled Posts Not Publishing On Time[¶](#scheduled-posts-not-publishing-on-time "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Scheduled Posts are published in WordPress through a WP-Cron job.
Normally, WordPress triggers the cron job each time a request hits the
backend. The backend is rarely hit, however, when using a cache, and
this causes scheduled posts to publish late.

LSCWP will correctly purge the cache when a scheduled post is published
in the cron job. All you need to do is make sure that you can reliably
hit the backend. This can be done by scheduling a cron job to hit
`wp-cron.php` at your ideal interval.

For Example, to update scheduled posts every 15 minutes:

::: highlight
        */15 * * * * wget http://your_wp_site/wp-cron.php
When using a server level cron job, WordPress suggests defining
`DISABLE_WP_CRON` in your `wp-config.php` file to disable checking
WP-Cron on a backend hit.

::: highlight
        define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
This may be useful in reducing the number of calls made to WP-Cron if
that is desired.

For a more in-depth discussion of this issue, [see our
blog](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/05/17/wpw-using-lscache-for-wp-with-scheduled-posts/).

### WP-Cron PHP Timing Out[¶](#wp-cron-php-timing-out "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Some WordPress plugins or operations may need to run very long PHP
proceses, but they may be killed by LiteSpeed Web Server with error 500
after 120 seconds. With that in mind, we have additional environment
variables that will resolve that issue.

#### noconntimeout[¶](#noconntimeout "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

You can use the `noconntimeout` variable in the `htaccess` file. Exlude
WP-Cron with this rule:

::: highlight
        <IfModule Litespeed> 
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule (wp-cron).php - [E=noconntimeout:1]
        </IfModule>
#### SetEnv/SetEnvIf[¶](#setenvsetenvif "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

You can use the `SetEnv`/`SetEnvIf` variable too, but we recommend using
it only in a vhost file.

::: highlight
        <IfModule Litespeed> 
        SetEnv Request_URI "(wp-cron).php" noabort noconntimeout
        </IfModule>
For additional examples and information on how to configure the server,
you can see [this wiki](/cp/cpanel/long-run-script/).

Both of these variables will allow you to run PHP processes with no
limits for the web pages affected by this `.htaccess` file.

## QUIC.cloud Issues[¶](#quiccloud-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#quiccloud-issues}

### QUIC.cloud queue issues[¶](#quiccloud-queue-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink} {#quiccloud-queue-issues}

Access to QUIC.cloud services is achieved through request queues. As
visitors access pages on your site, if those pages need to be sent to
QUIC.cloud for processing, the URLs are added to the appropriate request
queues.

::: {.admonition .example}
Example

You have a new blog post, which has never had Low-Quality Image
Replacements (LQIP) generated. When the first visitor accesses the new
post, the post\'s image URLs will be added to the LSCWP queue.
[![!An example of the LQIP
Queue](../images/troubleshoot04.png)](../images/troubleshoot04.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

Requests in the queue are sent to QUIC.cloud for processing on a
schedule that is controlled by the cron. You may override this schedule
and send requests for processing at any time by pressing the **Force
Cron** buttons on the **Dashboard** or any **Run Queue Manually**
button, located below the queue display, as shown in the screenshot
above.

::: {.admonition .important}
Important

When you force the queue to run manually, that only means that the
requests in the queue will be sent to QUIC.cloud immediately. QUIC.cloud
still must process the requests, and depending on server load, that may
take as much as 24 hours, especially early in the month when activity is
highest.
To diagnose issues with any of the QUIC.cloud request queues, you can
[turn on and monitor the Debug Log](#turn-on-the-debug-log). Be sure to
set **Debug Level** to `Advanced`.

## Third Party Plugin Issues[¶](#third-party-plugin-issues "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

### Google Analytics Issue[¶](#google-analytics-issue "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The Guest Mode incompatibility with Google Analytics has been fixed.
Please update your LiteSpeed plugin to the latest version.

### Google Adsense Conflict[¶](#google-adsense-conflict "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

The LiteSpeed Cache plugin fully integrates with Google Adsense and
should work out of the box without any manual intervention needed.

In some rare cases, a conflict with deferred or delayed JavaScript can
cause your ads not to show.

To ensure your Google Ads are displayed at the right time and without
any rendering issues, you can exclude `adsbygoogle` from being deferred
or delayed. Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Page Optimization \>
Tuning** and add `adsbygoogle` to three lists:

- **JS Excludes**
- **JS Deferred / Delayed Excludes**
- **Guest Mode JS Excludes**

Make sure in all three settings that `adsbygoogle` is on a line by
itself.

Click **Save**. Purge the cache by hovering over the LiteSpeed icon on
the Admin Bar and clicking **Purge All**.

If you continue to have problems, you can repeat the above process and
exclude `ad` from being deferred or delayed. Just be aware that this
will exclude any JS that includes the string `ad` and may have
implications beyond just excluding advertising.

### Currency/Language Switcher Plugins[¶](#currencylanguage-switcher-plugins "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Because these plugins are mostly PHP session-based, there\'s often no
way for LiteSpeed to make them cacheable. The plugin author needs to
change the plugin code to be compatible with LSCache. [See the
API](../api) for more information on how to do that.

However, if the currency switcher or language switcher uses a
predictable URL query string (for example, `?new-currency=USD`) when it
switches, you can use rewrite rules to create a cookie and set up a
cookie-based vary.

:::: {.admonition .tip}
Tip

If the plugin itself already sets a cookie, you can simply add the
following to the top of `.htacess`:

::: highlight
    <IfModule LiteSpeed>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Vary:plugin_cookie]
    </IfModule> 
Note that `plugin_cookie` is just an example. You would need to replace
it with the actual name of the cookie that the plugin sets.
For plugins that don\'t set their own cookies, here\'s how you would set
up a custom cookie-based vary. Let\'s say the currency is switched on
your site via this URL: `https://example.com/page?new-currency=USD`

We can use the `new-currency` string to create a cookie that we will
call `currency_cookie`. We\'ll give `currency_cookie` a default value of
`EUR`, and then instruct LiteSpeed to create cache varies based on the
value of the new `currency_cookie`, like so:

::: highlight
    <IfModule LiteSpeed>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !currency_cookie
    RewriteRule .* - [CO=currency_cookie:EUR:%{HTTP_HOST}:0:/:true:true]
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} new-currency=(.*)
    RewriteRule .* - [CO=currency_cookie:%1:%{HTTP_HOST}:0:/:true:true]
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Vary:currency_cookie]
    </IfModule>
This ruleset must be placed at the top of `.htaccess`. And of course,
`new-currency`, `EUR`, and `currency_cookie` are all examples. You\'ll
want to replace them with the actual query string used by the plugin,
your site\'s own default currency, and whatever name you want to use for
the custom cookie, respectively.

Here\'s what this ruleset actually does:

- The first `RewriteCond` line checks whether `currency_cookie` exists.
  If it doesn\'t, it sets `currency_cookie=EUR` to create the cookie and
  give it `EUR` as the default currency.
- The next `RewriteCond` detects when the currency is switched via the
  `new-currency` query string (like in our example, where
  `https://example.com/page?new-currency=USD` changes the currency to
  `USD`). The next rewrite rule then assigns `currency_cookie` the same
  value that it detects in `new-currency` (in this case, `USD`).
- The final rewrite rule instructs the LiteSpeed cache engine to vary on
  the value of the `currency_cookie` cookie.

This ruleset makes it possible to have a copy of the page stored in
cache for visitors using the `EUR` currency, and another copy cached for
visitors using the `USD` currency.

And if someone were to visit
`https://example.com/page?this-currency=AUD`, another copy would be
cached for visitors using the `AUD` currency.

### EU Cookie Consent[¶](#eu-cookie-consent "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If you have EU Cookie Consent on your site, you will need a cache vary.
Varying on the cookie allows two versions of each page to be stored in
cache - one for people who have consented to the cookie, and one for
those who have not yet done so.

Add the following line to `.htaccess`:

::: highlight
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Vary:%{ENV:LSCACHE_VARY_VALUE}+euCookie]
### Excluding Cookie-Based Plugins From Cache[¶](#excluding-cookie-based-plugins-from-cache "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

Some plugins, such as the YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin, are
incompatible with LSCache for WordPress. The simplest way to avoid
cache-related problems with them is to exclude their pages from cache
entirely.

#### Manually[¶](#manually "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

If a plugin is cookie-based, you need only add the plugin\'s specific
cookie to LiteSpeed Cache\'s Exclude settings.

[![!](../images/troubleshoot05.png)](../images/troubleshoot05.png){.glightbox
data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto"
desc-position="bottom"}

From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache \> Cache \>
Excludes**. Scroll down to **Do Not Cache Cookies** and enter
`plugin_cookie` in the box. Be sure to replace \"plugin_cookie\" with
the *actual* name of the plugin\'s cookie, as shown in the image. If you
are excluding multiple cookies in this setting, make sure each cookie
has its own line.

#### Built-in[¶](#built-in "Permanent link"){.headerlink}

We have some known incompatible plugins on our development to-do list.
We intend to fix LSCache compatibility with these plugins eventually,
but for now we have set up LSCache to *automatically* set them to Do Not
Cache.

If you are using one of these plugins, you do not have to use the manual
steps above! LSCache will automatically exclude them from cache.
